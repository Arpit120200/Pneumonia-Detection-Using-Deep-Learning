# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project presents an end-to-end implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying medical images into two categories: NORMAL and PNEUMONIA. By leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly DenseNet with transfer learning, we aim to automate pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images.
